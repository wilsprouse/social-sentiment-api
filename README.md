# Social Sentiment API

For a User:
This personal project is an api that retrieves and stores the social sentiment of a company at a given moment


For a contributor:
Uses Python (backend), MongoDB (storing sentiment), R (NLP)
Gets news stories from fidelity news, which aggregates many different news sources

Goal:
To have a way to quickly retrieve the social sentiment of a company in a REST api format, in turn this could be used
for quantitative research.

If the project was further developed in a professional setting, it would include more news sources, and would update
the sentiment automatically, at periods specified by the user.
